Title

Study and Implementation of Categorical Data Analysis in Python

Aim

To study and implement various techniques for analyzing categorical data using the Pandas library, including frequency distribution, cross-tabulation, and grouping.

Objectives

To understand the difference between nominal and ordinal categorical data.
To perform frequency counting and percentage distribution of categories.
To apply cross-tabulation (Crosstab) to find relationships between two variables.
To perform data grouping and sorting based on categorical features.
To filter specific subsets of data from a categorical dataset.
Theory

Categorical data represents types of data which may be divided into groups. In Python’s Pandas library, categorical data is handled efficiently to provide insights into patterns and distributions within a dataset.

1. Frequency Distribution

Frequency counting is the most basic form of categorical analysis. It involves counting how many times each unique value appears in a column. Normalized frequency provides the percentage distribution, allowing for a better understanding of the proportion of each category within the whole.

2. Cross-Tabulation (Crosstab)

Cross-tabulation is used to identify the relationship between two categorical variables. It creates a contingency table that displays the frequency distribution of the variables, such as comparing "Payment Method" across different "Product Categories" or "Gender" across "Grades".

3. Unique Value Identification

Identifying unique values is crucial for understanding the diversity of a dataset. The unique() function lists all distinct labels, while nunique() provides the total count of distinct categories.

Metadata and Exploration

Value Counts:Used to determine the frequency of categories like 'Electronics' or 'Clothing' in an order database, or 'Grades' in a student database.

Percentage Distribution: By using normalize=True, the data is transformed into percentages to show that a specific category might represent, for example, 40% of the total data.

Sorting and Filtering: Data is sorted alphabetically by category or filtered to isolate specific groups, such as extracting only orders belonging to the 'Electronics' category.

Advanced Categorical Analysis

Crosstab: This operation is applied to find overlaps, such as determining how many 'New' vs. 'Returning' customers chose 'Express' delivery.

Grouping (Groupby): This allows for multi-level analysis, such as seeing the distribution of grades specifically within each engineering department.

Applications of Categorical Analysis

Market Research: Analyzing customer preferences across different demographic categories.

Academic Performance: Studying the distribution of student grades across different departments.

Inventory Management: Tracking the frequency of sales across various product categories.Logistics: Comparing delivery types and payment methods to optimize supply chain efficiency.

Conclusion The experiment demonstrates that categorical data analysis is essential for extracting meaningful patterns from non-numerical data. By using value counts, cross-tabulation, and grouping, we can effectively summarize large datasets and understand the relationships between different variables, such as how student performance (Grade) varies across different departments.
